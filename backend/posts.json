This short-duration cropping window occurs between the Kharif and Rabi seasons and is ideal for crops like moong (green gram). As a result, a significant portion of the agricultural calendar has been underutilised until now.\n\nAgrix is working to change this by providing timely access to mechanisation and quality inputs, enabling farmers to make the most of the Zaid season. This initiative is significantly boosting farmers' yields and promoting sustainable land use.\n\nA key component of this transition is Agrix's harvesting machinery and comprehensive support system, which facilitates timely harvesting and access to quality agri-inputs. This not only reduces post-harvest losses but also enhances crop turnaround. Additionally, easy access to mechanisation improves operational efficiency while lowering labour burdens and costs.\n\nThe results are impressive—farmers are experiencing a 30–40% increase in annual yields. They also build greater resilience in their farming systems by improving crop diversity and soil health with nitrogen-fixing legumes like moong.\n\nThis achievement goes beyond just increasing yields; it represents a crucial step toward sustainable intensification, inclusive rural development, and long-term agricultural transformation—all made possible with the support of Agrix.\n",
